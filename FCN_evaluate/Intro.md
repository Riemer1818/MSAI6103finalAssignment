1.use FCN8s_cityscapes.pth as the pre-trained model, but there is no pre-trained FCN8s model on cityscapes online and due to time limitation, we do not train the FCN8s on the cityscapes.

2.evaluate.py is to test and get the score. parameters are required to run .py file and instructions are in itself.

tips:
align.py try to align the model structure between the model and .pth file
